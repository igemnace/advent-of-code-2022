# Advent of Code 2022

This is my solutions repo for [Advent of Code 2022][aoc].

## File Structure

Structure is simple enough: I go into `src/day-XX` and write my solutions there.

You may be wondering why I don't use `package.json` scripts at the moment.
That's because the repo structure is still in flux -- I want to entertain the
possibility of writing solutions for each day in different languages (for
practice): notably JS, Rust, and possible Haskell.

As these are toy programs at best (and not full software I intend to
distribute), I chose MIT instead of my preferred GPL to be more permissive.

page][license] for a nice, short explanation.
